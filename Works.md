I have made too many projects (even before high school graduation). So I created another page to introduce them.

1. [_AstralFlow_](https://github.com/InlinedLambdas/AstralFlow) -- A Framework for Custom Block/Machine/Item Mechanics.
2. [Youdao4J](https://github.com/iceBear67/Youdao4J) -- A simple crawler supports fetching tokens automatically.
3. [ezshare](https://github.com/iceBear67/ezshare) -- A simple and feature-rich file-sharing server using vert.x web. All in one
4. [gradi](https://github.com/iceBear67/gradi) -- An intelligent tool clears unused files in your Gradle cache directory.  
  Especially useful for forge/fabric users because nobody wants to rebuild those caches.
5. [_linguee_](https://github.com/iceBear67/linguee) -- Alternative `Text` solution for Spigot Servers.
6. [Shito](https://github.com/iceBear67/Shito) -- Universal message broadcaster. Define your pattern and we'll give a callback URL for you.
7. [_Kiwi_](https://github.com/InlinedLambdas/kiwi) -- A robust and easy util for Java, including some compile-time magics.

The following works are almost discontinued or I'm not willing to work with them at present, however, they worth being mentioned.

1. [PolarCore](https://github.com/saltedfishclub/PolarCore) -- The earliest(Java at least) universal IM platform. My first Java project.  
  It is under full rewrite and will be another project soon.  
  Also, there are some projects are developed around it: https://github.com/project-polar
2. [vapu](https://github.com/iceBear67/vapu) -- Utilizing mixin to crack Vape v4. Much harder than your thoughts.


I won't show you all of my works here, you can find them yourself.

* Some _Works_ are mainly hosted on CodeBerg. [Why?](https://ib67.io/2022/08/19/From-GitHub-To-Github/)
